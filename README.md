First, use the command 'curl' to download a file called 'go.tar.gz' which contains the Go programming language. Then, extract the contents of the file to the directory '/usr/local', and set the PATH environment variable to include the location of the Go executable. Check that the installation was successful by running the command 'go version'. 
 
Next, download a file called 'config.json' from GitHub using the 'wget' command. This file contains a piece of code that includes a list of IPv4 addresses in Iran in CIDR format. You can find this list on the website 'ip2location.com' under 'visitor-blocker'. The code also specifies the file 'IRip.txt' which contains the list of addresses. Once the code is executed, the output file 'geoip.dat' will be created, which will contain information about the Iran IP addresses.
